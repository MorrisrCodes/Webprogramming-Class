            Planes soar like loveâ€”weightless yet powerful, defying gravity with a whisper of faith. They bridge the distance between hearts, stitching the sky with longing and reunion. The hum of engines is a promise, the turbulence a test, and the landing a quiet sigh of relief. Love, like flight, is a leap into the unknown, but oh, the beauty of reaching the other side.
