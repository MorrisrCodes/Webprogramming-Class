                    <li>Using an external style sheet to hold the website design scheme basis for all pages</li>
                    <li>Using an embedded style sheet for a slightly altered design scheme for the specific page</li>
                    <li>Using in-line style sheets to alter specific points that go beyond the page scheme</li>

                <h1>Explalining the process</h1>
                <p>The reason styling in this manor is superior is because you can keep the pages consistent by setting font, background color, and general text color all the same by using the external style sheet. Then if you have a page that needs to contrast the last one you can change only the background color and text color while keeping font and other things the same using an embedded style sheet. Then lastly you can overwrite the text color for only one part using an in-line style sheet. This is superior to every teacher creating their own style sheet for each page, because if for instance every page had a different font or a slightly different shade of blue, it wouldn't look like the pages all went together.</p>

                    <li>div - a good tag for containers</li>
                    <li>br - added a new line or empty line</li>
                    <li>pre - for easy formatting, text comes at exactly as input</li>
